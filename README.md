# Bobble AI Assignment
In this C++ Assignment, two problems were given, which were based on Trie Data Structure. A dictionary in form of .csv file was given in both the problems. The two problems were:
## Problem 1: Find the Word:
In this problem, a dictionary containing words along with their frequency of occurence were given. We have to take user input as the word. The objective was to check if the word is present in the dictionary and if yes, then we have to give "Yes" as output along with its frequency, otherwise output will be "No". This problem is solved by using Trie Data Structure.


## Problem 2: Reverse Search:
In this problem, a dictionary containing words along with their frequency of occurence were given. We have to make a Trie out of that dictionary and mark each end node with numbers starting from 0 to N, where N should be equal to the total number of words in the dictionary. Then we have to take user input as any number between 0 to N and its frequency. We have to write a program which backtraces that node and find the exact word ending at that node.

## To execute the above Programs:
- Clone this Repository.
- g++ must be installed on the system to execute these files.
- Then open the folder where repository is cloned, and open a terminal window there.
- In the terminal window, type the following command to compile Find the Word program.
```bash
g++ First_Find_the_Word 
```
- In the terminal window, type the following command to compile Reverse Search program.
```bash
g++ Second_Reverse_Search 
```
To execute the program, type the following command in terminal window.
```bash
.\a.exe 
```
